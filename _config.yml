additionalinfo: |
    <strong>JVM</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have recently worked with Spring MVC 5, Spring Security 5, JPA/Hibernate.  In my current role Groovy is the primary language used - and I am familiar with many of the language's features. <br/><br/>
    <strong>Web Development</strong>: My server side web development experience has largely been based on RESTful Java via Jersey. I have also worked with some client side technology, having used Angular (both .js and .io), Extjs, jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Backbone/Underscore.<br/><br/>
    <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with Subversion, Git, Maven, Gradle, and Jenkins. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
    I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including OpenShift Origin/OKD. <br/><br/>
    I occasionally write a blog covering life, technical subjects, and opinion articles at: <a target='_blank' href="http://trash80.org/blog/">Nerd @ Play</a><br/><br/>
