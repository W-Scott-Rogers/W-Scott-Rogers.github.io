    <strong>Full Stack Development</strong>:<br/>
        I am experienced in a variety of Java and Groovy APIâ€™s and frameworks.<br/>
        I have recently worked with Spring MVC 5, Spring Security 5, JPA/Hibernate.<br/>
        I designed and developed a mapping technology for use by the Department of Defense.
        <div style="margin-left:2em;">The mapping technology is backed by Groovy and Java classes which collate information from an SQL Server database.<br/></div>
        I assisted in the design and development the client UI of a global map to track events utilizing libraries such as OpenLayers, ExtJS, and Angular.io.<br/>
        I designed and developed the RestFUL services in support of the mapping event tracker using Groovy 2, Jersey 1, Java 1.8, Apache Velocity Templates, and iBatis.<br/>
        I designed and developed of a PDF export of global event data using Java 1.8 and the Flying Saucer library.<br/>



    <br/>
        My server side web development experience has largely been based on RESTful Java via Jersey.<br/>
        I have also worked with client side technologies such as: Javascript, Angular (both .js and .io), Extjs, jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Backbone and Underscore.<br/>

    <br/>
    <strong>Development Control</strong>:<br/> I have good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with Subversion, Git, Maven, Gradle, and Jenkins.<br/>
        I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/>

    <br/>
    I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time.<br/>

    <br/>
    I occasionally write a blog covering life, technical subjects, and opinion articles at: <a target='_blank' href="http://trash80.org/blog/">Nerd @ Play</a><br/>
